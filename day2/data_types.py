##### Mutable and Immutable ######

# Mutable objects are those objects whose value can be changed
# even after it's creation

# Immutable objects are those objects whose value can't be changed
# once it is created.

# Integer, Float, Boolean, Tuple, Strings are immutable datatypes in python
# List, Dictionary and Set are the mutable datatypes in python

a = (1, 2, 3)  # Immutable Type
b = [1, 2, 3]  # Mutable Type

b[1] = 5  # This is possible as list is a mutable type
print(b)
# a[1] = 5  # This is not possible
