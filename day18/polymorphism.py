# Poly = Many
# Morphism = Forms

# For-example we have a len() function which works in different forms

print(len([1, 2, 3]))  # It works for a list
print(len((1, 2, 3)))  # It works for a tuple
print(len({"1": 1, "2": 2}))  # It also works for a dictionary


# Function Overloading

def addition(a, b):
    return a + b


def addition(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c


print(addition(1, 2, 3))
# print(addition(1, 2))   # This is not possible because function overloading
# is not possible in python


def addition(a, b, c=0):
    return a + b + c


def addition(*args):
    return sum(args)

print(addition(1, 2))
print(addition(1, 2, 3))
print(addition(1, 2, 3, 4))


# We can give the taste of function overloading by using default parameter. But, it is not actually
# a function overloading
print(addition(2, 3))
print(addition(2, 3, 4))



# Method overloading


class Shape:
    def area(self, l):
        return l * l

    # Method overloading is also not possible in python. But we can give its taste by using default
    # parameter
    def area(self, l, b=None):
        if not b:
            return l * l
        return l * b


square = Shape()
print(square.area(4))

rectangle = Shape()
print(rectangle.area(4, 5))
