# Tuple datatypes are similar to python list type but they are
# immutable

# Indexing and Slicing in tuple are same as that of list
# Empty tuple can be created using paranthesis () or tuple() buil-in fxn

t = tuple()  # An empty tuple
print(t)
t = ()  # An empty tuple
print(t)

t = (1, 2, 3)  # A non-empty tuple
print(t)
t = tuple([1, 2, 3])  # tuple() function takes iterable as a parameter


# Creating a tuple with single element
t = (1)  # This seems like a tuple but, it is an integer type
print(type(t))  # Int
t = (1, )  # We need to add a comma while creating tuple with single element
print(type(t))  # Tup




# Tuple Packing and Unpacking
t = 1, 2, "Hello World"  # A tuple can be created without using paranthesis as
# given in this example. This type of tuple creating is tuple packing


# Assigning of each tuple elements to individual variables in the LHS is called
# tuple unpacking
a, b, c = 1, 2, "Hello World"
print(a)  # Result => 1
print(b)  # Result => 2
print(c)  # Result => "Hello World"


# This is how we do swapping normally in other languages. With the use of third
# variable (c)
a = 1
b = 2

c = a
a = b
b = c
print(a)
print(b)

# Swapping can be implemented easily in Python with tuple packing and unpacking
a = 1
b = 2
a, b = b, a   # Swapping using tuple packing/unpacking
print(a)
print(b)


# Elements in LHS must be equal to RHS in tuple packing and unpacking else it raises
# an error
# a, b = 1, 2, 3  # This raises an error
# a, b, c = 1, 2  # This also raises an error


# Indexing and Slicing in tuple is same as that of list

a = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
print(a[::2])  # This traverse from forward jumping one step
#Result => (1, 3, 5, 7)

print(a[-2:-6:-1])  # Providing negative step size traverse the sequence
# from backward. Result => (6, 5, 4, 3)

print(a[::-1])  # This reverses the sequence. Result => (7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)


del a  # This deletes the tuple 'a' (del keyword deletes any object)
