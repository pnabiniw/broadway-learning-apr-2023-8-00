1. To create a new virtual environment
    => python -m venv venv

2. Activate venv for Linux / Mac
    source venv/bin/activate

3. Activate venv for Windows
    cd venv
    cd Scripts
    activate (This works for command prompt but not in powershell)

4. pip install <package_name>   # This installs the package from pypi
5. pip list   => This lists all the packages in the virtual environment
6. pip freeze => This also lists the packages in the environment
7. pip freeze > requirements.txt  => This lists all the packages in the requirements.txt file
8. pip install -r requirements.txt => This recursively installs packages from the requirements.txt file
9. pip uninstall <package_name>

10. deactivate  => this deactivates the virtual environment
